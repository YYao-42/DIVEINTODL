        "the relative expense of sensors,\n",
        "and the comparatively tighter research budgets in the 1990s,\n",
        "most research relied on tiny datasets.\n",
        "Numerous papers addressed the UCI collection of datasets,\n",
        "many of which contained only hundreds or (a few) thousands of images\n",
        "captured in unnatural settings with low resolution.\n",
        "\n",
        "In 2009, the ImageNet dataset was released,\n",
        "challenging researchers to learn models from 1 million examples,\n",
        "1000 each from 1000 distinct categories of objects.\n",

        "pushed computer vision and machine learning research forward,\n",
        "challenging researchers to identify which models performed best\n",
        "at a greater scale than academics had previously considered.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Missing Ingredient: Hardware\n",
        "\n",
        "Deep learning models are voracious consumers of compute cycles.\n",
        "Training can take hundreds of epochs, and each iteration\n",
        "requires passing data through many layers of computationally-expensive\n",
        "linear algebra operations.\n",
        "This is one of the main reasons why in the 1990s and early 2000s,\n",
        "simple algorithms based on the more-efficiently optimized\n",
        "convex objectives were preferred.\n",
        "\n",
        "*Graphical processing units* (GPUs) proved to be a game changer\n",
        "in making deep learning feasible.\n",
        "These chips had long been developed for accelerating\n",
        "graphics processing to benefit computer games.\n",
        "In particular, they were optimized for high throughput $4 \\times 4$ matrix-vector products, which are needed for many computer graphics tasks.\n",
        "Fortunately, this math is strikingly similar\n",
        "to that required to calculate convolutional layers.\n",
        "Around that time, NVIDIA and ATI had begun optimizing GPUs\n",
        "for general computing operations,\n",
        "going as far as to market them as *general-purpose GPUs* (GPGPU).\n",
        "\n",
        "To provide some intuition, consider the cores of a modern microprocessor\n",
        "(CPU).\n",
        "Each of the cores is fairly powerful running at a high clock frequency\n",
        "and sporting large caches (up to several megabytes of L3).\n",
        "Each core is well-suited to executing a wide range of instructions,\n",
        "with branch predictors, a deep pipeline, and other bells and whistles\n",
        "that enable it to run a large variety of programs.\n",
        "This apparent strength, however, is also its Achilles heel:\n",
        "general-purpose cores are very expensive to build.\n",
        "They require lots of chip area,\n",
        "a sophisticated support structure\n",
        "(memory interfaces, caching logic between cores,\n",
        "high-speed interconnects, and so on),\n",
        "and they are comparatively bad at any single task.\n",
        "Modern laptops have up to 4 cores,\n",
        "and even high-end servers rarely exceed 64 cores,\n",
        "simply because it is not cost effective.\n",
        "\n",
        "By comparison, GPUs consist of $100 \\sim 1000$ small processing elements\n",
        "(the details differ somewhat between NVIDIA, ATI, ARM and other chip vendors),\n",
        "often grouped into larger groups (NVIDIA calls them warps).\n",
        "While each core is relatively weak,\n",
        "sometimes even running at sub-1GHz clock frequency,\n",
        "it is the total number of such cores that makes GPUs orders of magnitude faster than CPUs.\n",
        "For instance, NVIDIA's recent Volta generation offers up to 120 TFlops per chip for specialized instructions\n",
        "(and up to 24 TFlops for more general-purpose ones),\n",
        "while floating point performance of CPUs has not exceeded 1 TFlop to date.\n",
        "The reason for why this is possible is actually quite simple:\n",
        "first, power consumption tends to grow *quadratically* with clock frequency.\n",
        "Hence, for the power budget of a CPU core that runs 4 times faster (a typical number),\n",
        "you can use 16 GPU cores at $1/4$ the speed,\n",
        "which yields $16 \\times 1/4 = 4$ times the performance.\n",
        "Furthermore, GPU cores are much simpler\n",
        "(in fact, for a long time they were not even *able*\n",
        "to execute general-purpose code),\n",
        "which makes them more energy efficient.\n",
        "Last, many operations in deep learning require high memory bandwidth.\n",
        "Again, GPUs shine here with buses that are at least 10 times as wide as many CPUs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Back to 2012. A major breakthrough came\n",
        "when Alex Krizhevsky and Ilya Sutskever\n",
        "implemented a deep CNN\n",
        "that could run on GPU hardware.\n",
        "They realized that the computational bottlenecks in CNNs,\n",
        "convolutions and matrix multiplications,\n",
        "are all operations that could be parallelized in hardware.\n",

        "![From LeNet (left) to AlexNet (right).](http://d2l.ai/_images/alexnet.svg)\n",
        ":label:`fig_alexnet`\n",
        "\n",
        "The design philosophies of AlexNet and LeNet are very similar,\n",
        "but there are also significant differences.\n",
        "First, AlexNet is much deeper than the comparatively small LeNet5.\n",
        "AlexNet consists of eight layers: five convolutional layers,\n",
        "two fully-connected hidden layers, and one fully-connected output layer. Second, AlexNet used the ReLU instead of the sigmoid\n",
        "as its activation function.\n",
        "Let us delve into the details below.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Architecture\n",
        "\n",
        "In AlexNet's first layer, the convolution window shape is $11\\times11$.\n",
        "Since most images in ImageNet are more than ten times higher and wider\n",
        "than the MNIST images,\n",
        "objects in ImageNet data tend to occupy more pixels.\n",
        "Consequently, a larger convolution window is needed to capture the object.\n",
        "The convolution window shape in the second layer\n",
        "is reduced to $5\\times5$, followed by $3\\times3$.\n",
        "In addition, after the first, second, and fifth convolutional layers,\n",
        "the network adds maximum pooling layers\n",
        "with a window shape of $3\\times3$ and a stride of 2.\n",
        "Moreover, AlexNet has ten times more convolution channels than LeNet.\n",
        "\n",
        "After the last convolutional layer there are two fully-connected layers\n",
        "with 4096 outputs.\n",
        "These two huge fully-connected layers produce model parameters of nearly 1 GB.\n",
        "Due to the limited memory in early GPUs,\n",
        "the original AlexNet used a dual data stream design,\n",
        "so that each of their two GPUs could be responsible\n",
        "for storing and computing only its half of the model.\n",
        "Fortunately, GPU memory is comparatively abundant now,\n",
        "so we rarely need to break up models across GPUs these days\n",
        "(our version of the AlexNet model deviates\n",
        "from the original paper in this aspect).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Activation Functions\n",
        "\n",
        "Besides, AlexNet changed the sigmoid activation function to a simpler ReLU activation function. On one hand, the computation of the ReLU activation function is simpler. For example, it does not have the exponentiation operation found in the sigmoid activation function.\n",
        " On the other hand, the ReLU activation function makes model training easier when using different parameter initialization methods. This is because, when the output of the sigmoid activation function is very close to 0 or 1, the gradient of these regions is almost 0, so that backpropagation cannot continue to update some of the model parameters. In contrast, the gradient of the ReLU activation function in the positive interval is always 1. Therefore, if the model parameters are not properly initialized, the sigmoid function may obtain a gradient of almost 0 in the positive interval, so that the model cannot be effectively trained.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Capacity Control and Preprocessing\n",
        "\n",
        "AlexNet controls the model complexity of the fully-connected layer\n",
        "by dropout (:numref:`sec_dropout`),\n",
        "while LeNet only uses weight decay.\n",
        "To augment the data even further, the training loop of AlexNet\n",
        "added a great deal of image augmentation,\n",
        "such as flipping, clipping, and color changes.\n",
        "This makes the model more robust and the larger sample size effectively reduces overfitting.\n",
        "We will discuss data augmentation in greater detail in :numref:`sec_image_augmentation`.\n"

This was also due to the lack of efficient computational tools.\n",
