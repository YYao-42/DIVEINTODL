        "* The core computation of a two-dimensional convolutional layer is a two-dimensional cross-correlation operation. In its simplest form, this performs a cross-correlation operation on the two-dimensional input data and the kernel, and then adds a bias.\n",
        "* We can design a kernel to detect edges in images.\n",
        "* We can learn the kernel's parameters from data.\n",
        "* With kernels learned from data, the outputs of convolutional layers remain unaffected regardless of such layers' performed operations (either strict convolution or cross-correlation).\n",
        "* When any element in a feature map needs a larger receptive field to detect broader features on the input, a deeper network can be considered.\n",
